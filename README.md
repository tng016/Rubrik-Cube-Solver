==== Rubrik Cube Solver ===

Created: October 2016

Status: Incomplete

General Idea of this program is user will input the current arrangement of a unsolved rubrik cube and the program will output a solution with the least number of required moves.

This will be done with a BFS algorithm on a graph with the starting vertex as the current state of the cube and the final vertex being the completed vertex.

=== Possible extensions to project ===

Using an Arduino and Servos/motors to implement the output solution onto a physical cube.
